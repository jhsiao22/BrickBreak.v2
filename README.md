# BrickBreak.v2
This is a second version of BrickBreak made freshman year of college (2014-2015) for my COMP 124 class. Although the premise of the game is still the same, perhaps there is more sophistication in some places where there wasn't before. Or, it's just another version of the same game. 

This is my newer version of BrickBreak, which might not actually be more sophisticated than my previous one. It's just a newer one written for a different class. I think both have good things and bad things about them.
